# Ultimate Guitar Scraper  

Ultimate-Guitar.com is the world's largest online database of guitar tablature. They also have a horrible UI that is filled with advertisements, interstitials, and other annoying stuff.  

I initially wrote this implementation in node.js, but as I'm trying to replace my Python and Node usage with Go in an effort to get better at the language I opted to release a partial Go proof of concept.  

## Features  

- [x] Fetch a tab by id  
- [ ] Search for tabs - Will add later  
- [ ] Fetch popular tabs - Will add later   

For an example, check out `./example/example.go`.
